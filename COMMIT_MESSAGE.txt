Add Rust workspace with separate AES and Dummy encryption plugins

Implement modular Senzing encryption plugin architecture with:

- sz_common: Shared utilities, traits, and error handling (394 lines)
- sz_aes_plugin: AES-256-CBC production encryption (533 lines)
- sz_dummy_plugin: XOR testing encryption (461 lines)

Features:
- C-compatible shared libraries for Senzing integration
- Comprehensive error handling and memory safety
- Thread-safe plugin lifecycle management
- Deterministic and non-deterministic encryption modes
- Base64 encoded output with ENC: prefix
- Complete test coverage (21 tests, all passing)

Generated libraries:
- libsz_aes_encrypt_plugin.so (AES256_CBC_PKCS7_B64_2024)
- libsz_dummy_encrypt_plugin.so (DUMMY_XOR_B64_2024)

Security: AES plugin uses secure random IVs, automatic memory clearing,
and proper PKCS#7 padding. Dummy plugin is for development/testing only.

Technical implementation:
- Rust 2024 edition with workspace dependencies
- Unsafe FFI code properly documented and isolated
- Memory safety with zeroize for sensitive data
- Thread-safe global state with Mutex
- Comprehensive error handling with structured types
- Full C interface compatibility for Senzing
